AndroidMultiChannelMiddleware
============================

This middleware for Android provides methods to communicate via Barcodes, Bluetooth, the Internet, NFC, and SMS. I created this project for my master thesis at the LMU Munich about "A middleware for transparent, interaction-based services". Please read the thesis (located in the folder "Documentation") for a more detailled explanation, including screenshots. The thesis is only available in German. There exists no English version.
